Why Should Learn C++
C++ is used in development of Core Software
    o Databases: Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, MemSQL, etc. used for YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc.
    o OS: Windows, Linux, Android, Ubuntu, iOS, etc. are written in a combination of C and C++
    o Compilers / VMs/ Tools: GNU Compiler Collection (CCC); JVM, PVM; MATLAB, IDE
    o Web Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
    o Graphic Engine: Applications in image processing, computer vision, screen recorders, games etc.
    o Embedded Systems: Smart watches, MP3 players, GPS systems, etc.
C++ has Core Strengths like
    o Fast, Portable, and Scalable
    o Offers multiple levels of Abstraction: hardware to objects to meta-programs
    o Multi-Paradigms: Imperative / Procedural (C / Python), Object-Oriented (Algol / Java), Functional (LISP), Generic / Meta-Programming (template, lambda), Concurrent (Java)

C++ has a Large Community
C++ has Abundant Library Support (STL)
C++ skills attract High Salary

Caveat
    O It takes more time to be skilled in C++ compared to, say, Python due to its complexity and diversity
    o It is better to use Java Python for simple front-end applications that are not performance critical
    o C++ is not best suited for front-end graphics applications for the lack of graphics library

    IO Header is iostream
    operator<< to stream to console
    Console is std: : cout ostream (in std namespace)
    operator<< is a binary operator
    std: :endl (in std namespace) to go to the new line
    std: : endl is stream manipulator (newline) functor
