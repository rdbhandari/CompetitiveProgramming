/*
    Strings are objects that represent sequences of characters
    The standard string class provides support for such objects with an interface similar to that of a standard container of bytes, but adding features specifically designed to operate with strings
of single-byte characters
    The string class is an instantiation of the basic-string class template that uses char (that is bytes) as its character type, with its default char-traits and allocator types
